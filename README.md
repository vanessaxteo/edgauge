# CalHacks Summer 2023 Devpost!

## Inspiration  
Have you ever been teaching a class and all of your students look like they're fighting for their lives to stay awake?

As Teaching Assistants here at UC Berkeley, it's quite common to see a classroom full of uninterested students, but it is also difficult to *add activities or pose questions on the spot* to re-engage your students. Additionally, it's often difficult to gauge exactly how your students are feeling at certain times and see how your students are reacting to *different pedagogical styles*, especially when teaching online.   

EdGauge serves to **provide a third eye for educators**, making teaching more engaging.  

## What EdGauge does (features)  
Essentially, EdGauge uses WHAT (computer vision? nlp? explain what hume uses lol) to identify students' emotions in order to provide instant feedback and advice for educators.   

**Target audience:** Educators, for any age and on any subject, to improve student engagement and boost learning experiences.

## Implementation (talk ab code)

## Challenges

## What we're proud of
This was our first hackathon for 3/4 members of our team! From spending hours brainstorming open-ended solutions to our everyday inconveniences to attending workshops and learning about successful, like-minded startups, this hackathon has been an incredible, invaluable learning experience for all of us.  

EdGauge is a **product of our personal teaching needs**. By facing common classroom issues surrounding boredom, needing feedback, and instant examples, as teaching assistants and classroom facilitators, we've found necessity in creating a product that helps both us and our students.

We all worked on something we've never done before and continued to explore our personal technological interests to create a final product that we personally find use in. 

## What's next for EdGauge  
We believe EdGauge has the potential to revolutionize teaching, as declining interest and attention-span within classrooms have become a rising issue. On a larger scale, EdGauge would be able to learn best teaching practices for students, WHAT.
