# CalHacks Summer 2023 Devpost!

## Inspiration  
Have you ever been teaching a class and all of your students look like they're fighting for their lives to stay awake?

As a Teaching Assistant, it's quite common to see a classroom full of uninterested students, but it is also difficult to *add activities or pose questions on the spot* to re-engage your students. Additionally, it's often difficult to gauge exactly how your students are feeling at certain times and see how your students are reacting to *different pedagogical styles*, especially when teaching online.   

EdGauge serves to **provide a third eye for educators**, making teaching more engaging.  

## What EdGauge does

## What we're proud of
This was our first hackathon for 3/4 members of our team! From spending hours brainstorming open-ended solutions to our everyday inconveniences to attending workshops and learning about successful, like-minded startups, this hackathon has been an incredible, invaluable learning experience for all of us.  

EdGauge is a product of our personal teaching needs. By facing common classroom issues surrounding boredom, needing feedback, and instant examples, as teaching assistants and classroom facilitators, we've found necessity in creating a product that helps both us and our students.

We all worked on something we've never done before and continued to explore our personal technological interests to create a final product that we personally find use in. 

## What's next for EdGauge  
We believe EdGauge has the potential to revolutionize teaching, as declining interest and attention-span within classrooms have become a rising issue. With a larger scale, EdGauge would be able to learn best teaching practices for students, WHAT.
