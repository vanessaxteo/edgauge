## Inspiration  
Have you ever been teaching a class and all of your students look like they're fighting for their lives to stay awake?

As a Teaching Assistant, it's quite common to see a classroom full of uninterested students, but it is also difficult to add activities or pose questions on the spot to re-engage your students. Additionally, it's often difficult to gauge exactly how your students are feeling at certain times and see how your students are reacting to different pedagogical styles, especially when teaching online.   

EdGauge serves to provide a third eye for educators, making teaching more engaging.
